## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding SwiftUI-Extensions as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/mjn2max/SwiftUI-Animations.git")
]
```

### Manually

If you prefer not to use any of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate SwiftUI-Animations into your project manually.

#### Embedded Framework
